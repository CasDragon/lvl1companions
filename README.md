A mod for Wrath of the Righteous

Features:
* Sets all companions recruit levels to 1 (if they weren't already). This should allow for better compatability with Barley's Respec mod, and also Toybox gestalt.
* Should include all the DLC companions as well

Known Issues:
* None?

Installation:
Install like a normal UMM mod, by dragging it onto the UMM installer or Modfinder

Probably unnecessary if you already have Homebrew Archetype's AC submod (which overwrites the base game companions recruit level to 1 as well)
